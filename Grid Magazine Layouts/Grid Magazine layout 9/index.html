You'll have to sell your speeder. That's okay. I'm never coming back to this plan&shy;et again. Going some&shy;where, Solo? Yes, Greedo. As a mat&shy;ter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money. It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jab&shy;ba's put a price on your head, so large that every boun&shy;ty hunter in the gal&shy;axy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first. Yeah, but this time I got the money. If you give it to me, I might forget I found you. I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba&hellip; Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smug&shy;glers who drop their ship&shy;ments at the fir&shy;st sign of an Imp&shy;erial cru&shy;iser. Even I get bored some&shy;times. Do you think I had a choice? You can &shy;tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship. Over my dead body. That's the idea. I've been look&shy;ing for&shy;ward to kill&shy;ing you for a long time. Yes, I'll bet you have. </p>
       
       <p class="mag__para mag__para--two">How long before you can make the jump to light speed? It'll take a few mom&shy;ents to get the coor&shy;dinates from the navi com&shy;puter. Are you kid&shy;ding? At the rate they're gaining&hellip; Travel&shy;ing thro&shy;ugh hyper&shy;space isn't like dust&shy;ing crops, boy! With&shy;out pre&shy;cise calc&shy;ulat&shy;ions we could fly right thro&shy;ugh a star or boun&shy;ce too close to a super&shy;nova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it? What's that flash&shy;ing? We're los&shy;ing our def&shy;lector shield. Go strap your&shy;self in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed.</p>
       <!--<p class="mag__para mag__para--three">We've entered the Alder&shy;aan system. Gove&shy;rnor Tarkin, I should have expect&shy;ed to find you holding Vader's leash. I recog&shy;nized your foul stench when I was brought on board. Charm&shy;ing to the last. You don't know how hard I found it sign&shy;ing the order to terminate your life! I sur&shy;pr&shy;ised you had the courage to take the res&shy;pons&shy;ibil&shy;ity yourself! Prin&shy;cess Leia, before your ex&shy;ecut&shy;ion I would like you to be my guest at a cer&shy;emony that will make this battle station oper&shy;ation&shy;al. No star system will dare oppose the Emp&shy;eror now. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>-->

I don't know what you're talk&shy;ing about. I'm a member of the Imp&shy;er&shy;ial Sen&shy;ate on a dip&shy;lom&shy;atic mission to Al&shy;der&shy;aan. You are a part of the reb&shy;el all&shy;;ian&shy;ce. and a trai&shy;tor. Take her away! Hold&shy;ing her is dan&shy;ger&shy;ous. If word of this gets out, it could gen&shy;er&shy;ate symp&shy;athy for the Re&shy;bel&shy;lion in the sen&shy;ate. I have tra&shy;ced the reb&shy;el spies to her. Now she is my only link to fi&shy;nd their sec&shy;ret ba&shy;se. She wi&shy;ll die be&shy;fo&shy;re she tel&shy;ls you any&shy;th&shy;ing. Lea&shy;ve that to me. Se&shy;nd a dis&shy;tr&shy;ess sig&shy;nal and then inf&shy;orm the sen&shy;ate that all ab&shy;oard were kil&shy;led! Lord Va&shy;der, the bat&shy;tle stat&shy;ion pla&shy;ns are not ab&shy;oard this ship. And no trans&shy;mis&shy;sions were made. An es&shy;cape pod was jet&shy;tis&shy;oned during the fight&shy;ing, but no life forms were ab&shy;oard. <!--She must have hid&shy;den the plans in the es&shy;cape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time. Yes, sir. --></p>
       <!--<p>Vader was seduced by the dark side of the force/ The force? Well, the force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend. And where you come from. I saw part of the message he was&hellip; I seem to have found it. Which reminds me&hellip; I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.</p>-->

       <!--<p class="mag__para mag__para--four">You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen. What makes you think that? Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben. That old man's just a crazy old wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now. But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him? He won't, I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father. He knew my father? I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.</p>
       
       <p class="mag__para mag__para--five">And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it! </p>-->
