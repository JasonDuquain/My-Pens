You'll have to sell your speeder. That's okay. I'm never coming back to this plan&shy;et again. Going some&shy;where, Solo? Yes, Greedo. As a mat&shy;ter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money. It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jab&shy;ba's put a price on your head, so large that every boun&shy;ty hunter in the gal&shy;axy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first. Yeah, but this time I got the money. If you give it to me, I might forget I found you. I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba&hellip; Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smug&shy;glers who drop their ship&shy;ments at the fir&shy;st sign of an Imp&shy;erial cru&shy;iser. Even I get bored some&shy;times. Do you think I had a choice? You can &shy;tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship. Over my dead body. That's the idea. I've been look&shy;ing for&shy;ward to kill&shy;ing you for a long time. Yes, I'll bet you have. </p>

Are you kid&shy;ding? At the rate they're gaining&hellip; Travel&shy;ing thro&shy;ugh hyper&shy;space isn't like dust&shy;ing crops, boy! With&shy;out pre&shy;cise calc&shy;ulat&shy;ions we could fly right thro&shy;ugh a star or boun&shy;ce too close to a super&shy;nova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it? What's that flash&shy;ing? We're los&shy;ing our def&shy;lector shield. Go strap your&shy;self in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed.</p>

           No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a nav&shy;iga&shy;tor on a space frei&shy;ghter. That is what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your fat&shy;her's id&shy;eals. Tho&shy;ught he sho&shy;uld have sta&shy;yed here and not got&shy;ten inv&shy;olved. You fou&shy;ght in the clo&shy;ne wars? Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your fat&shy;her. I wish I had kno&shy;wn him. He was the best star pi&shy;lot in the gal&shy;axy, and a cun&shy;n&shy;ing war&shy;rior. I un&shy;der&shy;st&shy;and you have bec&shy;ome qu&shy;ite a good pi&shy;lot your&shy;self. And he was a good fr&shy;iend. Which rem&shy;inds me, I have some&shy;thing here for you. Your fa&shy;ther want&shy;ed you to have this when you were old eno&shy;ugh, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damn&shy;ed fool ideal&shy;is&shy;tic cru&shy;sade like your father did. For over a tho&shy;us&shy;and gen&shy;er&shy;at&shy;ions, the Jedi Knights were the guard&shy;ians of peace and jus&shy;tice in the Old Rep&shy;ub&shy;lic. Before the dark times. Before the Empire. How did my father die? A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pu&shy;pil of mine until he turn&shy;ed to evil, help&shy;ed the em&shy;pire hunt down and des&shy;troy the Jedi kni&shy;ghts. He be&shy;tray&shy;ed and mur&shy;der&shy;ed your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was se&shy;duc&shy;ed by the dark side of the force. The force?
