       You must learn the ways of the Force. If you are to come with me to Alder&shy;aan. Alder&shy;aan?! I'm not going to Alder&shy;aan. I better get home it's late. I'm in for it as it is. She needs your help Luke. I need your help. I am getting too old for this sort of thing. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. 
     </p>
      <p>Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner. But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power con&shy;ver&shy;ters! You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now come on, get to it! All right, come on! And the red one, come on. Come on Red let’s go.</p>
      <p>
        Uncle Owen! Yeah? This R2 unit has a bad moti&shy;vator. Look! Hey, what’re you trying to push on us? Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime con&shy;dition. A real bargain. Uncle Owen? Yeah? What about that one? What about that blue one? We’ll take that one. Yeah, take it away.
      </p>

        Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be des&shy;perate. This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her ready. You’ll have to sell your speeder. That’s okay. I’m never coming back to this planet again. Going some&shy;where, Solo? Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I’ve got his money. It’s too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Jabba’s put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I’m lucky I found you first. Yeah, but this time I got the money.

        <em>He</em> is here. Obi&ndash;Wan Ken&shy;obi? What makes you think so? A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Surely he must be dead by now. Don’t under&shy;estimate the power of the Force. The Jedi are extinct. You, my friend, are all that’s left of their religion. 
      </p>
     
     <p>
       Obi&ndash;Wan is here. The force is with him. If he is here he must not be allowed to escape. Escape is not his plan. I must face him&hellip; alone.

        The Force is what gives a Jedi his powers. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surr&shy;ounds us, pene&shy;trates us, it binds the galaxy together.

        A fighter that size couldn’t get this deep into space on its own. He must of been part of a convoy and got lost. Well, he ain’t going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us. Look he’s headed for that small moon. I think I can get him before he gets there. That’s no moon. It’s a space station. It’s too big to be a space station. Turn the ship around. Yeah, I think your&apos;e right.

        Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power. Why are we still moving towards it? We’re caught in a tractor beam. It’s pulling us in. There’s gotta be something you can do! There’s nothing I can do about it, kid. I’m in full power. I’m going to have to shut down. But they’re not going to get me without a fight! You can’t win. But there are altern&shy;atives to fighting. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Your droids. We don't want them here. Listen, why don’t you wait out by the speeder. We don’t want any trouble. I heartily agree with you sir.

        Don't act so surprised, your high&shy;ness. You weren't on any mercy mission after all. Sev&shy;eral trans&shy;miss&shy;ions were beam&shy;ed up to this ship by rebel spies. I want to know what hap&shy;pened to the plans they sent you.

        Don't try to frighten us with your sor&shy;cerer's ways, Lord vader. Your sad dev&shy;otion to that an&shy;cient relig&shy;ion has not help&shy;ed you con&shy;jure up the stolen data tapes. Or given you clair&shy;voyance enough to find the rebel's hidden fort&hellip;. I find your lack of faith dis&shy;turbing. Enough of this! Vader, release him.
