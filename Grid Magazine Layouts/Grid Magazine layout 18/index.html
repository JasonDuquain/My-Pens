        Lord Vader, this is an unex&shy;pected pleasure. We're honor&shy;ed by your pres&shy;ence. You may dis&shy;pense with the pleasan&shy;tries com&shy;mander. I'm here to put you back on sched&shy;ule. I assure you, Lord Vader my men are work&shy;ing as fast as they can. Perhaps I can find new ways to mot&shy;ivate them. I tell you this station will be oper&shy;ational as plan&shy;ned. The emp&shy;eror does not share your opti&shy;mistic appraisal of the sit&shy;uation. But he asks the impos&shy;sible. I need more men. Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives. The emp&shy;eror is coming here!? We shall double our efforts. I hope you com&shy;mander for your sake. The emp&shy;eror is not as for&shy;giv&shy;ing as I am.
