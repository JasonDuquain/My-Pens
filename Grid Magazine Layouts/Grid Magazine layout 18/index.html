        Lord Vader, this is an unex&shy;pected pleasure. We're honor&shy;ed by your pres&shy;ence. You may dis&shy;pense with the pleasan&shy;tries com&shy;mander. I'm here to put you back on sched&shy;ule. I assure you, Lord Vader my men are work&shy;ing as fast as they can. Perhaps I can find new ways to mot&shy;ivate them. I tell you this station will be oper&shy;ational as plan&shy;ned. The emp&shy;eror does not share your opti&shy;mistic appraisal of the sit&shy;uation. But he asks the impos&shy;sible. I need more men. Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives. The emp&shy;eror is coming here!? We shall double our efforts. I hope you com&shy;mander for your sake. The emp&shy;eror is not as for&shy;giv&shy;ing as I am.

       <p>Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up. We're going in. We're going in full throttle. Right with you, boss. Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time? It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home. We'll stay back far enough to cover you. My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port! Are you sure the computer can hit it? Watch yourself! </p>

      <p>Open up in there! Oh, no! There isn't any other way out. I can't hold them off forever! Now what? This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out? He's the brains, sweetheart. What the hell are you doing? Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy. Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Get in there and don't worry about it. Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Get in there!</p>

Control, control. You must learn control. I saw.&hellip;I saw a city in the clouds. Mmm. Friends you have there. They were in pain. It is the future you see. Future? Will they die? Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future. I've got to go to them. Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.
