          Krat, Obi-Wan Kenobi? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time...a long time. I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead. Oh, he's not dead, not yet. You know him? Well of course &shy;I know him. He's me! I hav&shy;en't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, be&shy;fore you were born. Then the dro&shy;id does be&shy;long to you. I don't seem to re&shy;mem&shy;ber ever owning a droid. Very in&shy;teres&shy;ting. I think we better get in&shy;doors. The sand&shy;people are easily start&shy;led but they will soon be back and in great&shy;er numbers. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Three&shy;pio! Where am I? I must have taken a bad step. Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the sand&shy;people return. I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risk&shy;ing your&shy;self on my acc&shy;ount. I'm done for. No, you're not. What kind of talk is that? Quick&shy;ly, son they're on the move.

          I felt a great dis&shy;tur&shy;bance in the Force. As if mill&shy;ions of voices sud&shy;denly cried out in terror and were sud&shy;&shy;denly si&shy;len&shy;ced. I fear some&shy;thing terr&shy;ible has hap&shy;pened. You'd better get on with your exer&shy;cises. You can for&shy;&shy;get your trou&shy;bles with those Im&shy;&shy;per&shy;&shy;ial slu&shy;gs. I told you I'd out&shy;run 'em. Don't every&shy;one thank me at once. Any&shy;way, we sho&shy;&shy;uld be at Ald&shy;era&shy;an about oh 200 hours.

         Now be careful, Artoo. He made a fair move. Scream&shy;ing about it won't help you. Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wook&shy;iee. But sir, nobody worries about upset&shy;ting a droid. That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wook&shy;iees are known to do that. I see your point, sir. I sug&shy;gest a new str&shy;ategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win.

	                What is it, General? My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed. Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment. The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system. He felt surprise was wiser... He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack. Yes, my lord.

You'll know if any&shy;thing comes around. Has Comm&shy;ander Sky&shy;walker report&shy;ed in yet? No. He's check&shy;ing out a meteor&shy;ite that hit near him. With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be diff&shy;icult to spot approac&shy;hing ships. General, I've got to leave.  I
