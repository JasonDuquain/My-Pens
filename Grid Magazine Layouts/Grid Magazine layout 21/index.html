          Krat, Obi-Wan Kenobi? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time...a long time. I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead. Oh, he's not dead, not yet. You know him? Well of course &shy;I know him. He's me! I hav&shy;en't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, be&shy;fore you were born. Then the dro&shy;id does be&shy;long to you. I don't seem to re&shy;mem&shy;ber ever owning a droid. Very in&shy;teres&shy;ting. I think we better get in&shy;doors. The sand&shy;people are easily start&shy;led but they will soon be back and in great&shy;er numbers. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Three&shy;pio! Where am I? I must have taken a bad step. Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the sand&shy;people return. I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risk&shy;ing your&shy;self on my acc&shy;ount. I'm done for. No, you're not. What kind of talk is that? Quick&shy;ly, son they're on the move.

          I felt a great dis&shy;tur&shy;bance in the Force. As if mill&shy;ions of voices sud&shy;denly cried out in terror and were sud&shy;&shy;denly si&shy;len&shy;ced. I fear some&shy;thing terr&shy;ible has hap&shy;pened. You'd better get on with your exer&shy;cises. You can for&shy;&shy;get your trou&shy;bles with those Im&shy;&shy;per&shy;&shy;ial slu&shy;gs. I told you I'd out&shy;run 'em. Don't every&shy;one thank me at once. Any&shy;way, we sho&shy;&shy;uld be at Ald&shy;era&shy;an about oh 200 hours.

         Now be careful, Artoo. He made a fair move. Scream&shy;ing about it won't help you. Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wook&shy;iee. But sir, nobody worries about upset&shy;ting a droid. That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wook&shy;iees are known to do that. I see your point, sir. I sug&shy;gest a new str&shy;ategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win.
